        CI CoE provides expertise and active support to cyberinfrastructure practitioners at <Link to="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</Link> Major Facilities in order to
        accelerate the data lifecycle and ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the cyberinfrastructure upon which research and discovery depend.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        NSF's major multi-user research facilities (major facilities) are sophisticated research instruments and platforms
        &mdash; such as large telescopes, interferometers and distributed sensor arrays &mdash;
        that serve diverse scientific disciplines. Major facilities are increasingly dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI)
        &mdash; computing, data and software systems, networking, and associated human capital &mdash;
        to enable broad delivery and analysis of facility-generated data. As a result of these cyber infrastructure tools,
        scientists and the public gain new insights into fundamental questions.
        The goal of this pilot project is to develop a model for a Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence (CI CoE)
        that facilitates community building and sharing and applies knowledge of best practices and innovative solutions for facility CI.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The pilot project will explore how such a center would facilitate CI improvements for existing facilities and
        for the design of new facilities that exploit advanced CI architecture designs and leverage establish tools and solutions.
        The pilot project will also catalyze a key function of an eventual CI CoE &mdash; to provide a forum for exchange of experience and knowledge among CI experts.
        The project will also gather best practices for major facilities, with the aim of enhancing individual facility CI efforts in the broader CI context.
        The discussion forum and planning effort for a future CI CoE will also address training and workforce development
        by expanding the pool of skilled facility CI experts and forging career paths for CI professionals.
        The result of this work will be a strategic plan for a CI CoE that will be evaluated and refined through community interactions: workshops and direct engagement with the facilities and the broader CI community.

        Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (also known as drones) are becoming popular in the sky.
        Their application reaches from hobby drones for leisurely activities to life-critical drones for organ transport to commercial applications such as air taxis.
        The safe, efficient, and economic operation of such drones poses a variety of challenges that have to be addressed by the science community.
        For example, drones need very detailed, close to the ground weather information for safe operations,
        and data processing and energy consumption of drones need to be intelligently handled.
        This project will provide tools that will allow researchers and drone application developers to address operational drone challenges by using advanced computer and network technologies.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        This project will provide an architecture and tools that will enable scientists to include edge computing devices in their computational workflows.
        This capability is critical for low latency and ultra-low latency applications like drone video analytics and route planning for drones.
        The proposed work will include four major tasks.
        First, cutting edge network and compute infrastructure will be integrated into the overall architecture to make them available as part of scientific workflows.
        Second, in-network processing at the network edge and core will be made available through new programming abstractions.
        Third, enhanced end-to-end monitoring capabilities will be offered.
        Finally, the architecture will leverage the Pegasus Workflow Management System to integrate in-network and edge processing capabilities.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Providing best practices and tools that enable the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure for scientific workflows will have a broad impact on society in the long term.
        The science drivers that will be supported by this project have the potential to increase the safety and efficiency of drone applications,
        an area that will grow in significance in the foreseeable future.
        The project team will enable access to a rich set of resources for researchers and educators from a diverse set of institutions (historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs),
        community colleges, womenâ€™s colleges) to further democratize research.
        In addition, collaboration with the NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site in Consumer Networking
        will promote participation of under-served/under-represented students in project activities.

      <Paragraph>
        Scientific workflows are now being used in a number of scientific domains, including
        astronomy, bioinformatics, climate modeling, earth science, civil engineering, physics, and many others.
        Unlike monolithic applications, workflows often run across heterogeneous resources distributed across wide area networks.
        Some workflow tasks may require high performance computing resources, while others can run efficiently on high throughput computing systems.
        Workflows also access data from potentially different data repositories and use data, often represented as files, to communicate between the workflow components.
        Because of these data access patterns, the performance of networks and storage devices greatly influence how smoothly and quickly a workflow runs.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The PANORAMA project aims to address workflow performance through a three-pronged approach that involves:

      <List bullets="disc" items={[
        `developing analytical models that can predict the behavior of complex, data-aware scientific workflows executing in extreme-scale infrastructures;`,

        `discovering how to adapt the workflow execution and the infrastructure to achieve the potential performance predicted by the models.`,
      ]} />
      <Paragraph>
        Workflow performance will be studied using two Department of Energy applications
        that depend on workflows: <Link to="http://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/">Climate and Earth System Modeling</Link> (CESM),
        which processes large amounts of community data; and <Link to="https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns">Spallation Neutron Source</Link> (SNS),
        which produces rich experimental data used in a variety of complex analyses.

      <Subheading>RENCI's Role</Subheading>

      <Paragraph>
        <Link to="https://www.renci.org/">RENCI</Link> employs analytical performance models and monitoring information to facilitate detection and diagnosis of performance anomalies,
        to manage resources, and to adapt workflows as needed.
        The RENCI team will use models to predict expected application behavior, and combined with correlated monitoring information,
        will develop algorithms to automatically detect anomalies in system behavior and to automatically diagnose the most likely cause(s) of any found anomalies.
        An analysis capability will correlate workflow monitoring information with resource performance measurements to provide a better understanding of which resources contributed to an observed behavior.
        The RENCI team is also responsible for infrastructure and workflow adaptation in response to anomaly detection.
