                The Earth Data Science (EDS) group conducts research and applications into coastal hazard and risk problems associated with living along the coast.
                Primarily focused on weather-driven winds, storm surge, and waves, EDS uses state-of-the-art numerical/computational models
                together with data science approaches to characterize the threat posed by tropical cyclones and extra-tropical storms along the US eastern seaboard.
                From barrier islands to engineered levees, small details can matter significantly.
                The <Link to="https://adcirc.org/">ADCIRC</Link> tide, storm-surge, and wind-wave model is the primary engine for EDSâ€™s research and applications.
                Formulated using linear triangular finite elements, ADICRC enables very high-resolution representation of the complexities of the coast.
                Together with academic, federal, state, and industry collaborators, EDS runs the operational ADCIRC Prediction System that provides
                real-time information on storm surge during North Atlantic tropical cyclone events.

              <Paragraph>
                Specific application areas include optimal, risk-based evacuation modeling; impacts of hurricane rainfall on coastal water level predictions;
                interactions of technology and social mechanisms on risk communication; and climate impacts on coastal risks.
